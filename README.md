## Controlling Database Container
### Create docker network

If you already have it, skip to "Create & Start Container" section.

```
docker network create --driver bridge local-net
```

To see if it is created successfully, execute below.
```
docker network ls
```

If you want to remove the network, this is the command to do it.
```
docker network rm <network_name>
```

### Create & Start Container
Execute the command below in the directory where docker-compose.yml file resides.
This command creates and runs a container based on the configuration in this yml file.
```
docker-compose up -d
```

### Stop Container

```

### Start Container
Stopped container can be started again by start command.
```
docker-compose start
